// Capture captures the visible area of the currently active tab. Capture can only be started on
// the currently active tab after the extension has been invoked. Capture is maintained across page
// navigations within the tab, and stops when the tab is closed, or the media stream is closed by the extension.

// GetCapturedTabs returns a list of tabs that have requested capture or are being captured, i.e. status
// != stopped and status != error. This allows extensions to inform the user that there is an existing tab
// capture that would prevent a new tab capture from succeeding (or to prevent redundant requests for the same tab).

/*

// OnStatusChanged event fired when the capture status of a tab changes. This allows extension authors to keep track
// of the capture status of tabs to keep UI elements like page actions and infobars in sync.
